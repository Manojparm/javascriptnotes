// REPL Console of Js
/* REPL- Read evaluate print loop
Read-> read a valid command from the user.
Evaluate-> Whatever command user gave execute that and execute it
Print -> whatever is the result of the evaluation in next step,print the result
Loop-> return the process

whenever we actually execute any valid js code to browser,then
we are executing it with a repel console.That means whenever we
write a command it reads it,evalutes it and then print the return
value of it.

now with console log the return value is undefined,so when we
try to print anything in the browser using console.log then at
last we get an undefined printed for us.

This doesn't happen when you actualy execute something in vscode
or by embedding JS file in a index file.

when code is execute with VScode it is not repl console,so whatever
output is print that much show in vscode.
